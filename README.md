# Hi, I'm Simon!

I am interested in physics, 3d printing, minimalist free and open source softwatre and anything in between.

Currently I am studying physics in Germany. Therefore I pursue my other interests as a hobby.

Maybe you will even find something useful on my profile, but I wouldn't place my bet on that...
